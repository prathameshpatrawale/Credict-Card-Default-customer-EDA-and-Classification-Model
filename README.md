# Credict-Card-Default-customer-EDA-and-Classification-Model
This is my first project on EDA and Classification Model Building.
In this project, I first performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), then used a Logistic Regression model for prediction.
After that, I applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and finally used a Bagging technique (Voting Classifier) to select the best classification model.
